# Codexia

![Codexia header banner showing brand colors and tagline](assets/codexia-header.png)

**Engineering intelligence layer for repositories.**

Codexia understands your codebase, its history, its architecture, and its rules—and produces evidence-based insight, not guesses.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g codexia

# Run the interactive wizard
codexia
```

When you run `codexia` without any arguments, an interactive wizard guides you through all features:

```text
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🧠 Codexia - Engineering Intelligence │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

? What would you like to do?
  📊 Analyze - Scan, signals, impact analysis
  📋 Reports - PR reports, changelog, history
  🎯 Quality - Complexity, invariants, conventions
  🧪 Testing - Test suggestions, prioritization
  ⚙️  Setup - Initialize, watch mode, MCP server
```

Select a category, then choose a specific command—the wizard handles paths, options, and output format prompts for you.

Or use commands directly for scripting and CI:

```bash
codexia scan          # Full repository scan
codexia impact        # Analyze change impact
codexia signals       # Detect code smells
```

## What Codexia Does

### 🔍 **Repository Scanning**

Indexes your codebase to understand structure, symbols, exports, and dependencies.

```bash
codexia scan
```

### 📊 **Impact Analysis**

Shows exactly what your changes affect—which modules, which consumers, which tests.

```bash
codexia impact --staged
codexia impact --branch feature/new-api
```

### ✅ **Convention Checking**

Validates changes against your project's documented conventions and architectural rules.

```bash
codexia check
```

### 🧪 **Test Suggestions**

Recommends specific tests based on what code actually changed.

```bash
codexia tests
```

### 📝 **PR Reports**

Generates comprehensive pull request analysis with risk scores and evidence.

```bash
codexia pr-report --base main --head feature/new-api
```

### 🔗 **Dependency Visualization**

Visualize your dependency graph in multiple formats.

```bash
codexia graph                    # ASCII tree view
codexia graph --format mermaid   # Mermaid diagram
codexia graph --format dot       # Graphviz DOT format
codexia graph src/core/types.ts  # Focus on specific file
```

### 🧮 **Complexity Analysis**

Analyze code complexity, maintainability, and coupling metrics.

```bash
codexia complexity                     # Analyze all files
codexia complexity src/                # Specific directory
codexia complexity --threshold 60      # Show files below threshold
codexia complexity --symbols           # Include per-symbol breakdown
```

### 📜 **Git History Intelligence**

Understand temporal patterns, ownership, and risk from git history.

```bash
codexia history                   # Full temporal analysis
codexia history --churn           # File change frequency
codexia history --ownership       # Code ownership & bus factor
codexia history --coupling        # Files that change together
codexia history --regression-risk # Regression-prone areas
```

### 🛡️ **Architectural Invariants**

Enforce architectural rules and boundaries automatically.

```bash
codexia invariants              # Check all invariants
codexia invariants --init       # Generate example config
codexia invariants --strict     # Fail on any violation
```

### 🔥 **Hot Path Detection**

Identify critical code paths and their impact.

```bash
codexia hotpaths                     # Auto-detect entry points
codexia hotpaths -e src/index.ts     # From specific entry
codexia hotpaths --trace handleReq   # Trace through symbol
codexia hotpaths --impact src/db.ts  # Impact on hot paths
```

### 📋 **Changelog Generation**

Generate semantic changelogs from git history.

```bash
codexia changelog --from v1.0.0           # Since tag
codexia changelog --from HEAD~20          # Last 20 commits
codexia changelog --include-api           # Include API changes
codexia changelog -o CHANGELOG.md         # Write to file
```

### 📦 **Monorepo Support**

Analyze multi-package repositories (npm, yarn, pnpm, lerna, nx, turborepo).

```bash
codexia monorepo --detect           # Detect packages
codexia monorepo --graph            # Package dependency graph
codexia monorepo --impact @org/core # Cross-package impact
codexia monorepo --cycles           # Circular dependencies
```

### 👀 **Watch Mode**

Live analysis as you code.

```bash
codexia watch              # Watch and scan on changes
codexia watch --signals    # Watch and detect signals
codexia watch --impact     # Watch and analyze impact
codexia watch --check      # Watch and check conventions
```

### 🤖 **MCP Server (AI Integration)**

Model Context Protocol server for AI assistant integration.

```bash
codexia mcp-server                # Start stdio server (for Claude)
codexia mcp-server --port 3000    # Start HTTP server
```

### 📊 **Web Dashboard**

Beautiful, real-time visualization of your repository health.

```bash
codexia dashboard                 # Start dashboard server
codexia dashboard --port 3200     # Custom port
codexia dashboard --open          # Auto-open in browser
codexia dashboard --repo ~/work/my-service  # Start on a specific local repo
```

From the cloned Codexia repo, run the dashboard against the repo itself:

```bash
npm run dev:dashboard
```

The dashboard provides:
- **Repository Health Score** — Overall health with breakdown
- **Complexity Heatmap** — Visual file complexity overview
- **Repository Context Switcher** — Change analyzed local Git repo at runtime (manual path or Browse folder picker)
- **Jira Sprint Intelligence** — Sprint health, scope churn, and board integrity trends
- **Code Signals** — Issues ranked by severity
- **Hot Paths** — Critical areas needing attention
- **Team Leaderboard** — Contributor stats and activity
- **Commit Activity** — GitHub-style contribution heatmap
- **Code Ownership** — Bus factor and knowledge silo risks
- **Branch Overview** — Active and stale branches

## Security & Compliance

### Security Controls

Codexia ships with secure-by-default settings for local use and supports optional hardening for enterprise deployments. See:

- [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

### SOC 2 Alignment (Control Mapping)

Codexia provides technical controls that map to SOC 2 Common Criteria:

- **CC6 (Logical Access)**: Optional bearer-token auth for HTTP services, localhost binding by default.
- **CC7 (System Operations & Monitoring)**: Structured security logging for auth failures and invalid requests.
- **CC8 (Change Management)**: `npm run security:check` (lint, tests, dependency audit) for release gating.
- **CC9 (Risk Mitigation)**: Rate limiting and request size caps for public-facing endpoints.

Operational SOC 2 requirements (policies, access reviews, incident response, vendor risk) must be implemented by the deploying organization.

### GDPR Considerations

- Codexia processes **repository source code and git metadata** locally by default.
- If you enable AI providers, content may be sent to third parties; treat this as data export.
- Use data minimization: avoid sending sensitive files; set internal policy for secrets scanning.
- Define retention for logs and caches, and document a data processing policy.

Codexia does not ship with a built-in DPA. Enterprises should execute their own DPA with AI providers if used.

---

## AI Integration

Codexia includes optional AI-powered features for enhanced analysis:

### Configuration

Set your preferred AI provider via environment variables:

```bash
# OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Ollama (local, free)
export OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
```

### Features

AI integration enables:
- **Smart commit message generation**
- **Enhanced code explanations**
- **Intelligent refactoring suggestions**
- **Natural language queries** about your codebase

The system gracefully falls back if no API keys are configured—all core analysis features work without AI.

---

## Multi-Language Support

Codexia supports analysis across multiple programming languages:

| Language | Symbols | Dependencies | Complexity |
|----------|---------|--------------|------------|
| TypeScript/JavaScript | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Python | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Ruby | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Java | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Go | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Rust | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g codexia
```

Or use directly with npx:

```bash
npx codexia scan
```

Run as a standalone local app from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seshxn/codexia.git
cd codexia
npm install
npm run build
node dist/cli/index.js dashboard --repo /absolute/path/to/your/repo --open
```

---

## Project Memory

Codexia uses a `.codexia/` directory in your repository to store architectural knowledge:

```text
.codexia/
├── architecture.md    # System design and module boundaries
├── conventions.md     # Coding standards and patterns
├── invariants.md      # Rules that must never be broken
└── adrs/              # Architecture Decision Records
    ├── ADR-0001.md
    └── ADR-0002.md
```

This "memory" is:

- **Human-readable** — Plain Markdown files
- **Version-controlled** — Part of your repo
- **AI-consumable** — Structured for tooling

---

## Invariants Configuration

Define architectural rules in `codexia.invariants.yaml`:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: no-ui-in-core
    description: "Core modules should not import from UI layer"
    type: no-import
    from: "src/core/**"
    target: "src/ui/**"
    severity: error

  - name: max-dependencies
    description: "No file should have more than 15 imports"
    type: max-dependencies
    max: 15
    scope: "src/**"
    severity: warning
```

Supported rule types:
- `no-import` — Prevent imports between modules
- `require-import` — Require certain dependencies
- `layer-boundary` — Enforce architectural layers
- `naming-pattern` — Enforce naming conventions
- `max-dependencies` — Limit import count
- `annotation-required` — Require JSDoc annotations

---

## MCP Integration

Codexia exposes a Model Context Protocol server for AI assistants:

```bash
# For Claude Desktop, add to claude_desktop_config.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codexia": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["codexia", "mcp-server"]
    }
