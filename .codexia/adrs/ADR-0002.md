# ADR-0002: Evidence-Based Analysis Only

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-07-01

## Context

Many code analysis tools use heuristics or AI to make suggestions. We need to decide our approach.

## Decision

Codexia will only produce insights that are traceable to specific evidence in the codebase.

- No AI/ML-based suggestions
- No heuristic guessing
- Every output must cite its source (file, line, commit)

## Consequences

- More limited but more trustworthy analysis
- Users can verify any claim
- Complements (rather than competes with) AI coding tools
- May miss some patterns that require inference
